## Description

The DCI library for Ruby is a fairly faithful implementation of the DCI
concepts developed by Trygve Reenskaug, Reenskaug, and James O. Coplien.

It defines two reusable base classes, the Role and Context. The best way
to understand their usage is to look at the QED documentation provided
([for example](https://github.com/rubyworks/dci/blob/master/demo/account_example.md)).


## Installation

The usual RubyGems install procedure:

    $ gem install dci

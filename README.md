## Description

concpets developed by Trygve Reenskaug, Reenskaug and James O. Coplien.

It define two reusable base classes, the Role and Context. The best way
to understand their usage is to look at the QED documentation provided
([for example](https://github.com/rubyworks/dci/blob/master/demo/account_example.md)).
